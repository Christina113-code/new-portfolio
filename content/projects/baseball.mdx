# Replacing Spreadsheets with a Scalable Database

For a local small business that sold baseball cards, keeping track of sales, inventory, and customer records was becoming overwhelming with Excel. Our team set out to build an interactive database solution that would streamline these operations. The result? A robust, SQL-backed web application developed using **SQL, PHP, HTML, and CSS**.

# Learning to Work in a Team

One of the most rewarding aspects of this project was learning how to collaborate effectively. I had the opportunity to work with a teammate who had more industry experience—having worked as a **software engineer** in the past and currently involved in **PeopleSoft** at our university. This experience helped me grow as a developer in several ways:

- Understanding how experienced professionals approach software design
- Improving my ability to **communicate technical ideas clearly**
- Learning how to **divide tasks efficiently** based on skill sets

# Designing a SQL Database from Scratch

Before jumping into coding, we **designed an ER diagram and database schema** to structure our solution properly. The database included tables for:

- **Baseball Cards** (inventory management)
- **Customers** (tracking purchases and preferences)
- **Sales** (storing transaction history)
- **Suppliers** (managing shipments and stock levels)

Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of **database normalization, relational design, and indexing** for performance.

# Agile Development & Iterative Improvements

We followed **Agile methodology**, regularly meeting to **review client needs, iterate on the design, and implement feedback**. This iterative approach ensured that our solution remained aligned with business requirements. Some key practices we followed:

- **Regular check-ins** to assess progress and adjust priorities
- **Gathering client feedback** after each iteration
- **Rapid prototyping** to test features before full implementation

# Delivering a Solution on Deadline

With a clear roadmap, we successfully delivered the **final product within the set deadline**. The business now has an efficient system to manage their inventory, sales, and suppliers—something that was previously done manually with Excel.

# Key Takeaways

This project reinforced several key skills:

- **SQL database design**: Structuring tables, relationships, and queries efficiently
- **Full-stack development**: Using **PHP, HTML, and CSS** to build a functional web app
- **Client communication**: Understanding and implementing business needs
- **Project management**: Iterating quickly and delivering on time with **Agile methods**

# Final Thoughts

Building this database was a significant learning experience—both technically and professionally. Collaborating with an experienced software engineer, designing a scalable **SQL** solution, and adapting to client needs made this an incredibly rewarding project.
