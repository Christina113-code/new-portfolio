# Overview

Our team—**Christina Murphy (Team Leader), Johann Moreno, and Ethan Jacobson-Reynoso**—developed a **chemistry education website** designed to help students visualize and understand chemical concepts. The project utilized **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create an interactive and user-friendly platform.

# Project Goals

- Provide **interactive learning tools** for chemistry students
- Implement a **clean and engaging UI/UX**
- Ensure **responsive design** for accessibility across devices
- Integrate **dynamic content** using JavaScript

# Team Collaboration

As the **team leader**, I managed project planning, assigned tasks, and ensured smooth communication between team members. Each member contributed unique strengths:

- **Christina Murphy** – Project management, frontend development, REST API integration
- **Johann Moreno** – Styling and responsive design implementation
- **Ethan Jacobson-Reynoso** – JavaScript functionality and interactive elements 

# Technology Stack

We used the following technologies:

- **HTML** for structuring the content
- **CSS** for styling and layout design
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and dynamic elements
- **PubChem** REST API for data fetching

# Design & Development Process

1. **Planning & Research**
   - Brainstorming essential features
   - Sketching wireframes
   - Drafting initial mockups

2. **Database & ER Diagrams**
   - Designed an **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram** to outline data structures
   - Defined relationships between chemical elements, reactions, and user interactions

3. **Development & Implementation**
   - Built the frontend structure using **HTML & CSS**
   - Developed interactive components using **JavaScript**
   - Integrated animations and dynamic content


4. **Testing & Iteration**
   - Conducted usability testing
   - Fixed bugs and optimized performance
   - Implemented feedback for improvements

# Challenges & Solutions

- **Ensuring Responsiveness**: Used **CSS Flexbox and Grid** for adaptive layouts
- **Handling Dynamic Content**: Implemented **JavaScript event listeners** for interactive elements
- **Optimizing Load Time**: Minimized CSS and JavaScript files for better performance

# Final Thoughts

Leading this project was a valuable learning experience in both **technical development and team collaboration**. We successfully created a **functional, interactive chemistry education platform**, reinforcing our skills in **web development, UI/UX design, and project management**.

We look forward to expanding the site with additional features in the future!
